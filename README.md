# questionnaire_creator
Tool for creating questionnaires for 360 degree project controlling.

One of my first projects with PHP made some years ago.

The tool consists of creating questionnaires for projects in the format of a .php file that can be used to evaluate in a 360 degree qualitative factors of clients, suppliers and collaborators within projects. The tool can be combined with the access project found in my repositories. 

The questions are saved as templates found in text files.

For installing use the sql and change all the mention 'testdatabase' and also the access.php
